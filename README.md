create a github profile for me so that i can use it to showcase my skiils to recruiters for placements as a btech cse final year fresher
Here is a complete GitHub profile setup you can copy‑paste and then customize for yourself as a final‑year B.Tech CSE fresher targeting placements.​

Step 1: Basic profile setup
Do these once your account is created:

Username: something clean and professional, like yourname, yourname-dev, or yourname-ai.​

Photo: clear headshot with plain background (no group pics or memes).​

Bio (one line):
Final-year B.Tech CSE | Aspiring Software & AI Engineer | Building full‑stack and AI projects ​

Links: add your LinkedIn, email, and portfolio (if any) in the profile “Links” section.​

Step 2: Create the profile README
On GitHub, create a new repository with the exact same name as your username, set it to Public, and check “Add a README”. This README becomes your profile landing page.​

Replace its contents with this template:

text

## GitHub stats (optional)

![YOUR NAME's GitHub stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=YOUR_USERNAME&show_icons=true&theme=default)

![Top Langs](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/top-langs/?username=YOUR_USERNAME&layout=compact)
(Replace ALL CAPS placeholders with your details and adjust tech stack/projects to be accurate.)

Step 3: Arrange content for recruiters
Recruiters usually skim: headline, pinned repos, recent activity, and README sections like “Tech stack” and “Featured projects”. Use this order to make it easy:​

Section recruiters see first	What you should ensure
Top banner + short intro	Clear role (e.g., “Aspiring Software / AI Engineer”) and graduation year. ​
Pinned repositories	3–6 projects with clean code, clear READMEs, and (if possible) live demos or screenshots. ​
Tech stack	Only list tools you can actually use in a basic project. ​
Activity graph	Show consistent contributions, even small ones, over months. ​
Step 4: Next actions for you
Create GitHub account and profile README using the above template.​

Push at least 3 solid projects (EV rental, 1 AI/ML project, 1 DSA/CP or systems project) with good README files.​

Pin these repos and add your GitHub link to your resume and LinkedIn.​

If you share your current resume + tech stack + project details, a tailored version of this README can be written with exact bullet points and repo names for you.

Create a new GitHub repository with exactly your GitHub username as the repo name (e.g., if your username is john-doe-dev, create repo john-doe-dev). Make it Public.

Add a README.md file to this repo and paste the entire markdown content above into it.

Save and commit. Your GitHub profile homepage will now display this professional README!

Pin 3–6 of your best repos on your profile so recruiters see them immediately when they visit.
